# Roadmap.sh - Python 

## Introduction

This repository contains my progress in Python according to the roadmap provided by [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/python).

Each section of the roadmap will have two sections: `Information` and `Example`.

The `Information` section will contain the information and resources that roadmap.sh provides for that section.

The `Example` section will contain the code that I have written to demonstrate my understanding of the concepts in that section.

## Purpose

There are two main purposes for this repository:

1. To demostrate that I didn't just clicked through the roadmap, but actually learned the concepts.

2. To provide a resource for others who are learning Python and want to see examples of the concepts in action.

## Learn the Basics

### Basic Syntax

#### Information

- [Article] [W3Schools - Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
- [Article] [Python Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_syntax.htm)
- [Article] [Learn X in Y Minutes / Python](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)
- [Article] [Python for Beginners - Learn Python in 1 Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8)

#### Example

The best code example to show the basic syntax of Python would be to just copy the "Learn X in Y Minutes" so please, just go and check it out.

### Variables and Data Types

#### Information

Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.
